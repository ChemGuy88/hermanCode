# README

A collection of templates and utility code used by Herman. Not really geared for publication, but rather for his personal use.

## Important files

Files of the form `limericks_in_*.sh` contain no actual important information, but point to the files that have that information. The files `limeirkcs_in.sh` and `limeirkcs_out.sh` are reserved for future use, should the shell package need any such important information.

## Computer name

The computer name is used in this package to know what machine is in operation. To standardize computer names see the journal article [Computer Name](journal/articles/Computer%20Name.md).
